# HipHack
This repository holds the REST API deployed on Heroku for a small HipChat slash command integration called InspireBot.
When setting up the HipChat integration, post to this URL: https://hiphack.herokuapp.com/hipchat/inspiration.
The slash command is: /inspire.

After configuring properly, type /inspire in the chatroom and an inspirational quote should appear.
